# ðŸ§  fMRI

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is used to measure and map brain activity based on the principle that changes in blood flow and oxygenation in the brain are linked to neural activity.

## Axial FSPGR Bravo

A specific type of MRI sequence is used for acquiring anatomical images.

**Axial** images are captured in a horizontal plane, perpendicular to the
longitudinal axis of the body (In brain imaging, axial images are often used
to view structures from the top down).

**FSPGR Bravo** is a specific MRI sequence known as Fast Spoiled Gradient Echo
(FSPGR) and it is a type of gradient echo sequence that provides
high-resolution images with good contrast between different tissues. The Bravo implementation is commonly used for anatomical imaging of the brain and other body parts.

## 3 Plane Loc

**3 Plane Loc** refers to acquiring images in three orthogonal planes:

- **Sagittal**: Imaging plane that divides the body or structure into left and right halves.
- **Coronal**: Imaging plane that divides the body or structure into front and back halves.
- **Axial**: As mentioned earlier, this plane divides the body or structure into top and bottom halves.

The localizer scan is a quick preliminary scan used to determine the proper positioning of subsequent scans.
